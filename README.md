# Crowdfunder

A basic crowdfunding app that has a lot of features that could be implemented.

## Setup

1. One group member should fork the repository to their account
2. Add other group members as collaborators
3. Clone the repository to your local machine
4. Make sure Postgres is running
4. Run `bundle install` (This project uses PostgreSQL, it must be running first!)
5. Run `rails db:setup`

Your project should be ready to work on, with seed Projects and Users in the database.
