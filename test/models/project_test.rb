  # To implement the story:
  # "As a user, when I create a new project I should become that projectâ€™s owner"

  # 1. Remove the above test
  # 2. Remove the 'skip' line from one of the following tests
  # 3. Run the tests, and watch it fail
  # 4. Implement the smallest changes to make them pass
  # 5. Repeat until the test passes
  # 6. Repeat entire process from step 2 for the second test
